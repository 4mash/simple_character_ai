# Character AI Unofficial Node API

< add characterai image here >

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Character AI API](https://character.ai/), an awesome website which brings characters to life with AI!

## Intro

**Preface:**

This package is a completely reworked and revamped version of the `1.0+` `node_characterai` version series, that used old endpoints and were worked on from 2023 to 2024 until the CharacterAI team has completely deprecated the endpoints and websites on September 10th, 2024.

The old version has stayed a long time and still currently works partly to this day but is at risk of deprecation and uses old features that are not available anymore and or does not fully utilize all the new features the new endpoint and website has to offer and utilized features like Puppeteer to get around some restrictions.

This new version has been rewritten in mind to be as developer-friendly as possible, and with type safety in mind; a [long requested feature](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai/issues/102).

**Old intro:**

This repository is inspired by [RichardDorian's unofficial node API](https://github.com/RichardDorian/node-character.ai/).
Though, I found it hard to use and it was not really stable and archived. So I remade it in javascript.

**This project is not affiliated with Character AI in any way! It is a community project.**
The purpose of this project is to bring and build projects powered by Character AI.
